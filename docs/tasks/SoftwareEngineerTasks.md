# Software Engineering Tasks

This document outlines the implementation status of software engineering tasks in the project, focusing on code organization, documentation, and production readiness.

## 1. Code Organization and Documentation

### Requirements Status:

#### Clear Code Organization ✅
The project follows a clear and logical structure:
```
src/
├── processors/      # Data processing components
├── detectors/       # Detection algorithms
├── metrics/         # Evaluation metrics
├── models/          # ML model implementations
└── utils/           # Utility functions
```

#### Basic README with Essential Setup and Usage Info ✅
The project includes a comprehensive README.md that covers:
- Project overview
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- Development setup

#### Clean Code Practices ✅

1. **Clear Function Names**
   - Implemented in `src/processors/text_vectorizer.py`:
     ```python
     def calculate_similarity()
     def transform()
     def fit()
     ```
   - Implemented in `src/detectors/conversation_detector.py`:
     ```python
     def detect()
     def _validate_messages()
     def _get_cache_key()
     ```

2. **Basic Documentation**
   - All classes and methods include docstrings following Google style
   - Type hints are used consistently
   - Example from `text_vectorizer.py`:
     ```python
     def calculate_similarity(
         self,
         texts1: Union[str, List[str], pd.Series],
         texts2: Optional[Union[str, List[str], pd.Series]] = None
     ) -> np.ndarray:
         """
         Calculate cosine similarity between text vectors.
         
         Args:
             texts1: First set of texts
             texts2: Optional second set of texts
             
         Returns:
             Matrix of similarity scores
         """
     ```

3. **Helpful Comments for Complex Logic**
   - Implemented in vector similarity calculations
   - Cache management logic
   - Edge case handling

4. **Basic Dependency Handling**
   - Dependencies managed through `requirements.txt`
   - Version constraints specified
   - Core dependencies:
     - scikit-learn
     - numpy
     - pandas
     - cachetools

### Questions and Answers:

#### How would you ensure your script runs consistently across different machines?
The project implements several consistency measures:

1. **Environment Management**
   - Requirements.txt for dependency management
   - Version pinning for critical packages
   - Environment variable handling

2. **Path Handling**
   - Uses relative paths
   - OS-agnostic path separators
   - Configurable cache directories

3. **Data Processing**
   - Consistent text preprocessing
   - Standardized vector normalization
   - Platform-independent file operations

#### What steps would you take to make the codebase maintainable?
The project implements several maintainability features:

1. **Modular Design**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent components
   - Interface-based design

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Type hints
   - Usage examples

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for components
   - Test coverage reporting

#### How would you handle version conflicts between dependencies?
The project implements several dependency management strategies:

1. **Version Pinning**
   - Specific version requirements
   - Compatibility checks
   - Regular updates

2. **Dependency Isolation**
   - Virtual environment support
   - Containerization ready
   - Clear dependency boundaries

## 2. Production Deployment

### Requirements Status:

The project includes production configuration features:

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-based settings
   - Default configurations
   - Override capabilities

2. **Environment Variables**
   - API keys
   - Resource limits
   - Feature flags

3. **Resource Considerations**
   - Memory management
   - Cache size limits
   - Batch processing

### Questions and Answers:

#### How would you handle sensitive configuration data in a production environment?
The project implements several security measures:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Sensitive data stored in .env files
   - Not committed to version control
   - Secure loading mechanisms

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access
   - API key management
   - Secure storage

#### What monitoring and logging strategies would you implement?
The project includes several monitoring features:

1. **Logging**
   - Structured logging
   - Log levels
   - Log rotation
