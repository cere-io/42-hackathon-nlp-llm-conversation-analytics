# NLP/LLM Conversation Analytics - Interview Tasks

## Overview
This interview consists of three main components:
1. **Data Science Tasks**: Focusing on data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing
2. **AI/ML Tasks**: Focusing on text vectorization and similarity analysis
3. **Software Engineering Tasks**: Focusing on code organization, production readiness, and deployment

While completing these tasks successfully demonstrates excellent technical capability, we're equally interested in understanding your problem-solving approach, thinking process, and working habits throughout the interview. ðŸ˜Š

## ðŸ“Š Data Science Tasks
This section evaluates your ability to work with real data, handle data cleaning, and prepare text for analysis.

<details>
<summary>1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing - Explore and clean conversation data</summary>

**Requirements:**
- Parse the dataset from: [`data/groups/thisiscere/messages_thisiscere.csv`](data/groups/thisiscere/messages_thisiscere.csv)
- Implement data cleaning operations:
  - Handle missing values
  - Remove irrelevant columns
  - Format timestamps
  - Text cleaning (special characters, standardization)
  - Optional: Implement spam message detection and filtering
- Implement text tokenization:
  - Handle word boundaries
  - Process punctuation and special characters
  - Manage case sensitivity
  - Optional: stop words removal, contraction handling
- Document your implementation decisions
