This PR introduces the initial implementation of the conversation analytics system, focusing on establishing a robust and secure foundation for future development.

## 🎯 Core Implementation
- Secure logging system with sensitive data protection
- Foundation for conversation analysis pipeline
- Basic project structure and configuration

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices
- Automatic masking of sensitive data (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- JSON formatted logs with rotation for better manageability
- Secure storage location for logs using system temp directory
- YAML-based configuration for flexibility
