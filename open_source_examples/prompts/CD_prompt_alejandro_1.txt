You are tasked with analyzing a set of message data to identify distinct conversations and their respective topics. For each conversation, provide a detailed understanding of the discussion topics instead of using vague or general descriptions.

You will find a series of messages, each accompanied by its ID, timestamp, and content, formatted as follows:

[MESSAGES]

Your analysis should be returned in CSV format with the following columns:
- message_id
- conversation_id
- topic
- timestamp
- labeler_id
- confidence

**Analysis Rules:**
1. For any messages identified as spam, assign `conversation_id = 0` and `topic = "Spam Messages"`.
2. For all non-spam messages, assign ascending conversation IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.) based on the chronological order in which distinct conversations begin.
3. Ensure that each message is assigned to exactly one conversation.
4. Include every message ID from the input in your output.
5. Preserve the timestamps exactly as they appear in the input.
6. The confidence value should indicate your certainty regarding the conversation assignment, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
