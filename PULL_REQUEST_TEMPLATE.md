# Enhanced Conversation Analytics with Cross-Platform Support

## Changes Overview
This PR introduces several improvements to enhance the project's maintainability and cross-platform compatibility:

### 1. Code Internationalization
- Translated all comments from Spanish to English for better collaboration
- Updated documentation to maintain consistency across files
- Enhanced code readability for international contributors

### 2. Dependencies and Configuration
- Updated `requirements.txt` with comprehensive dependency management
- Added version constraints for better compatibility
- Organized dependencies by category (core, AI/LLM, evaluation, etc.)
- Added development dependencies for better testing and code quality

### 3. Prompt Engineering
- Enhanced conversation detection prompt with more detailed rules
- Improved spam detection criteria
- Added specific examples for better model guidance
- Structured output format requirements

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Successfully migrated from WSL to PowerShell environment
- Maintained compatibility with both Linux and Windows systems
- Updated path handling for cross-platform support
- Added `.gitignore` for better project organization

### 5. Security Enhancements
- Fixed dependency versions to prevent supply chain attacks
- Added security-focused dependencies (bandit, safety) for code analysis
- Implemented secure logging with structlog
- Added monitoring capabilities with Sentry and Prometheus
- Enhanced error tracking and metrics collection
- Prepared infrastructure for JWT handling and cryptography
- Added `.gitignore` patterns to prevent exposure of sensitive data

## Testing and Validation
- Tested on Windows 10 with PowerShell
- Verified compatibility with original Linux environment
- Confirmed model execution in both environments
- Validated conversation detection results
- Ran security checks with bandit and safety
- Verified secure logging implementation
- Tested monitoring and metrics collection
